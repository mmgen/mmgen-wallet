### MMGen Wallet Version 14.0.0 Release Notes

This special release marks the MMGen Projectâ€™s 10th anniversary on Github.

Though only one new noteworthy feature has appeared in MMGen Wallet since
v13.3.0, users can benefit from numerous bugfixes, code cleanups, and
installation and testing improvements, along with updated coin daemon support.

while the package toplevel currently remains `mmgen`.
