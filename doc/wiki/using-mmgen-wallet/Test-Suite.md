## Introduction

In addition to low-level subsystems, the suite tests the overall operation of
MMGen Wallet’s commands by running them interactively as a user would.  Thus the
test suite is useful not only for ensuring the MMGen Wallet system is correctly
installed and working on your platform but also for demonstrating how it works.

BTC-only testing requires installation of Bitcoin Core and pycoin only, while
altcoin testing requires additional helper programs and libraries, installation
instructions for which are provided below.  Non-standard RPC ports and data
directories are always used, so there’s no need to stop any running nodes.

On Linux/x86\_64 with a reasonably fast processor, the full suite should run in
under 20 minutes when invoked with the `-F` option.  Execution times on other
platforms may be much slower.

## Quick start

### Container setup (if applicable)

The test suite requires the `/dev/loopX` devices to exist and be enabled.  If
you’re running in an LXC container, note that only privileged containers allow
loop devices.  You may enable them in the config file as follows:

```text
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow = b 7:0 rwm # /dev/loop0
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow = b 7:1 rwm # /dev/loop1
lxc.cgroup2.devices.allow = b 7:2 rwm # /dev/loop2
```

Every time the container is started, you may need to create the files afresh:

```text
# mknod /dev/loop0 b 7 0
# mknod /dev/loop1 b 7 1
# mknod /dev/loop2 b 7 2
```

### BTC-only testing

Clone the Bitcoin Core repo somewhere on your system:

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin
```

Install the Bitcoin Core daemon [(source)][sd] [(binaries)][bd].

Point the test suite to your copy of the Bitcoin Core repo:

```text
$ export CORE_REPO_ROOT=/path/to/bitcoin/core/repo
```

Install Pycoin:

```text
# online install:
$ python3 -m pip install pycoin

# offline install:
$ python3 -m pip download pycoin # online
$ python3 -m pip install --no-build-isolation pycoin-*.tar.gz # offline
```

Install Pylint:

```text
$ python3 -m pip install pylint
```

CD to the MMGen Wallet repository root and build without installing:

```text
$ cd path/to/mmgen/repo
$ python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Run the following if upgrading from a previous version of MMGen:

```text
$ test/cmdtest.py clean
```

Run the test suite in fast mode, skipping altcoin tests:

```text
$ test/test-release.sh -FA
```

### Complete testing (BTC plus all supported altcoins)

Complete the BTC-only installation steps above, without running the test.

Make sure the [Bitcoin Cash Node][cnd], [Litecoin][ld] and [Monero][md]
daemons are installed on your system.

Install [Parity, Geth and the ETH Python requirements][oe], optionally the
[Solidity compiler][sc], and [the XMR Python requirements][xr] as described on
the Altcoin-and-Forkcoin-Support page.

In addition, you must install the following helper programs and libraries (MSYS2
users can omit Zcash-Mini and leave out `sudo` in commands):

#### SSH daemon setup (MSYS2 only)

The XMR test sets up a local SOCKS proxy to test transaction relaying.  This
requires the SSH daemon to be set up and running.  On MSYS2 systems, SSHD
is not configured by default, but it may be easily set up with the following
steps:

Open PowerShell as administrator, and at the DOS prompt, execute:

```text
system32> net user administrator /active:yes
system32> C:\\msys64\usr\bin\bash.exe --login
```

Now, at the MSYS2 prompt, cd to the MMGen Wallet repository root and run the
setup script:

```text
$ scripts/msys2-sshd-setup.sh
```

The daemon should now start automatically every time the system is booted. It
may also be started and stopped manually at the DOS or MSYS2 prompt as follows
(PowerShell must be running with admin privileges):

```text
# net start msys2_sshd
# net stop msys2_sshd
```

#### Monero-Python

```text
$ python3 -m pip install pycryptodomex ipaddress varint
$ python3 -m pip install --no-deps monero
```

#### Vanitygen PlusPlus (forked from Vanitygen Plus)

```text
$ git clone https://github.com/10gic/vanitygen-plusplus
$ cd vanitygen-plusplus
$ git checkout -b vanitygen-plus e7858035d092  # rewind to fork commit
$ make keyconv # ‘mingw32-make.exe keyconv’ for MSYS2
$ sudo install --strip keyconv /usr/local/bin  # ‘keyconv.exe’ for MSYS2
$ cd ..
```

#### Zcash-Mini

```text
$ sudo apt-get install golang  # skip this if Go is already installed
$ git clone https://github.com/FiloSottile/zcash-mini
$ cd zcash-mini
$ go mod init zcash-mini
$ go mod tidy
$ go build -mod=mod # or just ’go build’
$ sudo install --strip ./zcash-mini /usr/local/bin
$ cd ..
```

#### Ethkey

On Arch Linux and ArchLinuxArm systems, the ‘ethkey’ utility is included in the
OpenEthereum package:

```text
$ pacman -S openethereum
```

For 64-bit Windows and Linux systems, ‘ethkey’ can be found in the zip archives
distributed with [this release][oz].

For other systems (i.e. Debian/Ubuntu ARM), tests involving ‘ethkey’ are skipped.

#### Monero note

The Monero test (`test/test-release.sh xmr`) creates a private network and
mines coins, so is therefore non-deterministic and prone to random failures.
If you experience such a failure, just restart the test.

### Run the tests

Now you can run the test suite for all coins:

```text
$ test/test-release.sh -F
```

## Overview of the individual tests

`test/test-release.sh` is just a simple shell script that invokes the test
scripts with various options and arguments to ensure complete coverage of
MMGen Wallet’s functionality.  Launch the script with the `-t` option to view
the invocations without running them.

The test scripts themselves are all located in the `test/` directory and bear
the `.py` extension.  They may be run individually if desired.  Options and
arguments required by the tests are described in detail on their help screens.

High-level testing of the MMGen Wallet system is performed by `test/cmdtest.py`,
which uses the `pexpect` library to simulate interactive operation of MMGen
Wallet’s user commands.  Running `test/cmdtest.py` with the `-e` option will
display the commands’ output on the screen as they’re being run.
