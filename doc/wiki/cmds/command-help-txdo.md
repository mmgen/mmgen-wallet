                         satoshis per byte (an integer followed by 's').
                         See FEE SPECIFICATION below.  If omitted, fee will be
                         calculated using network fee estimation.

                         online signing without an MMGen seed source. The
                         key-address file is also used to verify MMGen-to-BTC
                         mappings, so the user should record its checksum.
  -O, --old-incog-fmt    Specify old-format incognito input

  -u, --subseeds       n The number of subseed pairs to scan for (default: 100,
                         maximum: 1000000). Only the default or first supplied
                         wallet is scanned for subseeds.

  -y, --yes              Answer 'yes' to prompts, suppress non-essential output
  -z, --show-hash-presets Show information on available hash presets


  The transaction’s outputs are listed on the command line, while its inputs
  are chosen from a list of the wallet’s unspent outputs via an interactive
  menu.  Alternatively, inputs may be specified using the --inputs option.

  Addresses on the command line can be either native coin addresses or MMGen
  IDs in the form SEED_ID:ADDRTYPE_CODE:INDEX.

  Outputs are specified in the form ADDRESS,AMOUNT or ADDRESS.  The first form
  creates an output sending the given amount to the given address.  The bare
  address form designates the given address as either the change output or the
  sole output of the transaction (excluding any data output).  Exactly one bare
  address argument is required.

  For convenience, the bare address argument may be given as ADDRTYPE_CODE or
  SEED_ID:ADDRTYPE_CODE (see ADDRESS TYPES below). In the first form, the first
  unused address of type ADDRTYPE_CODE for each Seed ID in the tracking wallet
  will be displayed in a menu, with the user prompted to select one.  In the
  second form, the user specifies the Seed ID as well, allowing the script to
  select the transaction’s change output or single output without prompting.
  See EXAMPLES below.

  A single DATA_SPEC argument may also be given on the command line to create
  an OP_RETURN data output with a zero spend amount.  This is the preferred way
  to embed data in the blockchain.  DATA_SPEC may be of the form "data":DATA
  or "hexdata":DATA. In the first form, DATA is a string in your system’s native
  encoding, typically UTF-8.  In the second, DATA is a hexadecimal string (with
  the leading ‘0x’ omitted) encoding the binary data to be embedded.  In both
  cases, the resulting byte string must not exceed 80 bytes in length.

  If the transaction fee is not specified on the command line (see FEE
  SPECIFICATION below), it will be calculated dynamically using network fee
  estimation for the default (or user-specified) number of confirmations.
  If network fee estimation fails, the user will be prompted for a fee.

  Network-estimated fees will be multiplied by the value of --fee-adjust, if
  specified.


  ADDRESS TYPES:

    Code Type           Description
    ---- ----           -----------
    ‘L’  legacy       - Legacy uncompressed address
    ‘C’  compressed   - Compressed P2PKH address
    ‘S’  segwit       - Segwit P2SH-P2WPKH address
    ‘B’  bech32       - Native Segwit (Bech32) address
    ‘E’  ethereum     - Ethereum address
    ‘Z’  zcash_z      - Zcash z-address
    ‘M’  monero       - Monero address


                                 FEE SPECIFICATION

  Transaction fees, both on the command line and at the interactive prompt, may
  be specified as either absolute BTC amounts, using a plain decimal number, or
  as satoshis per byte, using an integer followed by 's', for satoshi.


                                   SIGNING NOTES

  Transactions may contain both MMGen or non-MMGen input addresses.

  To sign non-MMGen inputs, a bitcoind wallet dump or flat key list is used
  as the key source (--keys-from-file option).

  To sign MMGen inputs, key data is generated from a seed as with the
  mmgen-addrgen and mmgen-keygen commands.  Alternatively, a key-address file
  may be used (--mmgen-keys-from-file option).

  Multiple wallets or other seed files can be listed on the command line in
  any order.  If the seeds required to sign the transaction’s inputs are not
  found in these files (or in the default wallet), the user will be prompted
  for seed data interactively.

  To prevent an attacker from crafting transactions with bogus MMGen-to-Bitcoin
  address mappings, all outputs to MMGen addresses are verified with a seed
  source.  Therefore, seed files or a key-address file for all MMGen outputs
  must also be supplied on the command line if the data can’t be found in the
  default wallet.

  Seed source files must have the canonical extensions listed in the 'FileExt'
  column below:

  EXAMPLES:

    Send 0.123 BTC to an external Bitcoin address, returning the change to a
    specific MMGen address in the tracking wallet:

      $ mmgen-txdo bc1qj87nveegsvwmz8yj759xgua2vx2tzsywlny44t,0.123 01ABCDEF:B:7

    Same as above, but select the change address automatically:

      $ mmgen-txdo bc1qj87nveegsvwmz8yj759xgua2vx2tzsywlny44t,0.123 01ABCDEF:B

    Same as above, but select the change address automatically by address type:

      $ mmgen-txdo bc1qj87nveegsvwmz8yj759xgua2vx2tzsywlny44t,0.123 B

    Same as above, but reduce verbosity and specify fee of 20 satoshis
    per byte:

      $ mmgen-txdo -q -f 20s bc1qj87nveegsvwmz8yj759xgua2vx2tzsywlny44t,0.123 B

    Send entire balance of selected inputs minus fee to an external Bitcoin
    address:

      $ mmgen-txdo bc1qj87nveegsvwmz8yj759xgua2vx2tzsywlny44t

    Send entire balance of selected inputs minus fee to first unused wallet
    address of specified type:

      $ mmgen-txdo B

  MMGEN v15.1.dev18              March 2025                      MMGEN-TXDO(1)
```
