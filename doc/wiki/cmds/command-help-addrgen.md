                             NOTES FOR THIS COMMAND

  Address indexes are given as a comma-separated list and/or hyphen-separated
  range(s).

  If available, the libsecp256k1 library will be used for address generation.


                        NOTES FOR ALL GENERATOR COMMANDS

  SUBWALLETS:

  Subwallets (subseeds) are specified by a ‘Subseed Index’ consisting of:

    a) an integer in the range 1-1000000, plus
    b) an optional single letter, ‘L’ or ‘S’

  The letter designates the length of the subseed.  If omitted, ‘L’ is assumed.

  Long (‘L’) subseeds are the same length as their parent wallet’s seed
  (typically 256 bits), while short (‘S’) subseeds are always 128-bit.
  The long and short subseeds for a given index are derived independently,
  so both may be used.

  MMGen Wallet has no notion of ‘depth’, and to an outside observer subwallets
  are identical to ordinary wallets.  This is a feature rather than a bug, as
  it denies an attacker any way of knowing whether a given wallet has a parent.

  Since subwallets are just wallets, they may be used to generate other
  subwallets, leading to hierarchies of arbitrary depth.  However, this is
  inadvisable in practice for two reasons:  Firstly, it creates accounting
  complexity, requiring the user to independently keep track of a derivation
  tree.  More importantly, however, it leads to the danger of Seed ID
  collisions between subseeds at different levels of the hierarchy, as
  MMGen checks and avoids ID collisions only among sibling subseeds.

  An exception to this caveat would be a multi-user setup where sibling
  subwallets are distributed to different users as their default wallets.
  Since the subseeds derived from these subwallets are private to each user,
  Seed ID collisions among them doesn’t present a problem.

  A safe rule of thumb, therefore, is for *each user* to derive all of his/her
  subwallets from a single parent.  This leaves each user with a total of two
  million subwallets, which should be enough for most practical purposes.

  PASSPHRASE NOTE:

  For passphrases all combinations of whitespace are equal, and leading and
  trailing space are ignored.  This permits reading passphrase or brainwallet
  data from a multi-line file with free spacing and indentation.

  BRAINWALLET NOTE:

  To thwart dictionary attacks, it’s recommended to use a strong hash preset
  with brainwallets.  For a brainwallet passphrase to generate the correct
  seed, the same seed length and hash preset parameters must always be used.
