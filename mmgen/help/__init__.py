The transaction’s outputs are listed on the command line, while its inputs
are chosen from a list of the wallet’s unspent outputs via an interactive
menu.  Alternatively, inputs may be specified using the --inputs option.

All addresses on the command line can be either {proto.name} addresses or MMGen
IDs in the form <seed ID>:<address type letter>:<index>.

Outputs are specified in the form <address>,<amount>, with the change output
specified by address only.  Alternatively, the change output may be an
addrlist ID in the form <seed ID>:<address type letter>, in which case the
first unused address in the tracking wallet matching the requested ID will
be automatically selected as the change output.

If the transaction fee is not specified on the command line (see FEE
SPECIFICATION below), it will be calculated dynamically using network fee
estimation for the default (or user-specified) number of confirmations.
If network fee estimation fails, the user will be prompted for a fee.

Network-estimated fees will be multiplied by the value of --fee-adjust, if
specified.

To send the value of all inputs (minus TX fee) to a single output, specify
a single address with no amount on the command line.  Alternatively, an
addrlist ID may be specified, and the address will be chosen automatically
as described above for the change output.

Transactions may contain both {pnm} or non-{pnm} input addresses.

To sign non-{pnm} inputs, a {wd}flat key list is used
as the key source (--keys-from-file option).

To sign {pnm} inputs, key data is generated from a seed as with the
{pnl}-addrgen and {pnl}-keygen commands.  Alternatively, a key-address file
may be used (--mmgen-keys-from-file option).

Multiple wallets or other seed files can be listed on the command line in
any order.  If the seeds required to sign the transaction’s inputs are not
found in these files (or in the default wallet), the user will be prompted
for seed data interactively.

To prevent an attacker from crafting transactions with bogus {pnm}-to-{pnu}
address mappings, all outputs to {pnm} addresses are verified with a seed
source.  Therefore, seed files or a key-address file for all {pnm} outputs
must also be supplied on the command line if the data can’t be found in the
default wallet.

SUBWALLETS:

Subwallets (subseeds) are specified by a ‘Subseed Index’ consisting of:

  a) an integer in the range 1-{SubSeedIdxRange.max_idx}, plus
  b) an optional single letter, ‘L’ or ‘S’

The letter designates the length of the subseed.  If omitted, ‘L’ is assumed.

Long (‘L’) subseeds are the same length as their parent wallet’s seed
(typically 256 bits), while short (‘S’) subseeds are always 128-bit.
The long and short subseeds for a given index are derived independently,
so both may be used.

MMGen Wallet has no notion of ‘depth’, and to an outside observer subwallets
are identical to ordinary wallets.  This is a feature rather than a bug, as
it denies an attacker any way of knowing whether a given wallet has a parent.

Since subwallets are just wallets, they may be used to generate other
subwallets, leading to hierarchies of arbitrary depth.  However, this is
inadvisable in practice for two reasons:  Firstly, it creates accounting
complexity, requiring the user to independently keep track of a derivation
tree.  More importantly, however, it leads to the danger of Seed ID
collisions between subseeds at different levels of the hierarchy, as
MMGen checks and avoids ID collisions only among sibling subseeds.

An exception to this caveat would be a multi-user setup where sibling
subwallets are distributed to different users as their default wallets.
Since the subseeds derived from these subwallets are private to each user,
Seed ID collisions among them doesn’t present a problem.

A safe rule of thumb, therefore, is for *each user* to derive all of his/her
subwallets from a single parent.  This leaves each user with a total of two
million subwallets, which should be enough for most practical purposes.
