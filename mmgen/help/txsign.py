Transactions may contain both {pnm} or non-{pnm} input addresses.

To sign non-{pnm} inputs, a {wd}flat key list is used
as the key source (--keys-from-file option).

To sign {pnm} inputs, key data is generated from a seed as with the
{pnl}-addrgen and {pnl}-keygen commands.  Alternatively, a key-address file
may be used (--mmgen-keys-from-file option).

Multiple wallets or other seed files can be listed on the command line in
any order.  If the seeds required to sign the transaction’s inputs are not
found in these files (or in the default wallet), the user will be prompted
for seed data interactively.

To prevent an attacker from crafting transactions with bogus {pnm}-to-{pnu}
address mappings, all outputs to {pnm} addresses are verified with a seed
source.  Therefore, seed files or a key-address file for all {pnm} outputs
must also be supplied on the command line if the data can’t be found in the
default wallet.
