"""
scripts/gendiff.py:

Clean up control characters and trailing whitespace in the listed source files
and create a unified diff between them.

If more or less than two files are listed on the command line, the cleanup is
performed on all files, but no diff is created.

The source files are assumed to be terminal output captured by the `script`
command.

The cleaned source files are saved with the .clean extension.
